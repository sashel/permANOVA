function [SSQs, DFs, MSQs, Fs, Ps] = mixed_b1_w1_anova_fast(X,suppress_output)
%% Vectorized version of the MIXED_BETWEEN_WITHIN_ANOVA simple function of Matthew Johnson
% Source: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27080-mixed-between within-subjects-anova
% Adapted by Saskia Helbling
%% Header of M. Johnson
%  Based loosely on BWAOV2 (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/5579-bwaov2) by Antonio Trujillo-Ortiz
%  (insofar as I used that function to figure out the basic equations, as it is apparently very hard to find documentation
%  on mixed-model ANOVAs on the Internet). However, the code is all original.
% 
% The major advantage of this function over the existing BWAOV2 is that it corrects a bug that occurs when the groups
%  have unequal numbers of subjects, as pointed out in the Matlab Central File Exchange by Jaewon Hwang. The code is also,
%  at least in my opinion, much cleaner.
% 
% At present this function only supports mixed models with a single between-subjects factor and a single within-subjects
%  (repeated measures) factor, each with as many levels as you like. I would be happy to add more bells and whistles in
%  future editions, such as the ability to define multiple factors, apply Mauchly's test and add in non-sphericity 
%  corrections when necessary, etc. I'm a better programmer than I am a statistician, though, so if anyone out there would 
%  like to lend a hand with the math (e.g., feed me the equations for these features), I'd be more than happy to implement 
%  them. Email matthew DOT r DOT johnson AT aya DOT yale DOT edu
% 
% Also feel free to modify this file for your own purposes and upload your changes to the Matlab Central File Exchange if 
%  you like.
% 
% I have checked this function against the example data in David M. Lane's HyperStat online textbook, which is the same 
%  data that breaks BWAOV2 (http://davidmlane.com/hyperstat/questions/Chapter_14.html, question 6). I have also checked it
%  against SPSS and gotten identical results. However, I haven't tested every possible case so bugs may remain. Use at 
%  your own risk. If you find bugs and let me know, I'm happy to try to fix them.

%      USAGE
% ===============
% 
% Inputs:
% 
% X: design matrix with four columns (future versions may allow different input configurations)
%     - first column  (i.e., X(:,1)) : all dependent variable values
%     - second column (i.e., X(:,2)) : between-subjects factor (e.g., subject group) level codes (ranging from 1:L where 
%         L is the # of levels for the between-subjects factor)
%     - third column  (i.e., X(:,3)) : within-subjects factor (e.g., condition/task) level codes (ranging from 1:L where 
%         L is the # of levels for the within-subjects factor)
%     - fourth column (i.e., X(:,4)) : subject codes (ranging from 1:N where N is the total number of subjects)
% 
% suppress_output: defaults to 0 (meaning it displays the ANOVA table as output). If you don't want to display the table,
%  just pass in a non-zero value
% 
% Outputs:
% 
% SSQs, DFs, MSQs, Fs, Ps : Sum of squares, degrees of freedom, mean squares, F-values, P-values. All the same values 
%  that are shown in the table if you choose to display it. All will be cell matrices. Values within will be in the same 
%  order that they are shown in the output table.
%
